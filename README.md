# Problem Solving Patterns in Java

This repository contains Java implementations of commonly used coding patterns to solve a wide range of algorithmic problems efficiently.

## ðŸ“Œ Patterns Covered

1. Two Pointers  
2. Hash Maps and Sets  
3. Linked Lists  
4. Fast & Slow Pointers  
5. Sliding Window  
6. Binary Search  
7. Stacks  
8. Heaps  
9. Intervals  
10. Prefix Sum  
11. Trees  
12. Tries  
13. Graphs  
14. Backtracking  
15. Dynamic Programming  
16. Greedy

Each folder includes well-known problems, clean and readable Java code, and inline comments for clarity.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Patterns?

Recognizing these patterns helps you identify optimal approaches quickly during coding interviews and avoids brute-force solutions.
